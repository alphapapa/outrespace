Outrespace
==========

In the beginning was the void.  
`void`

From the creator emerged the word.  
`hello world`

And lo the word was judged to be good.  
`"compilation succeeded"`

Now was creation organized into statements, and from statements, expressions.  And braces arose therewith, to delimit.  
`{}`

The glory of all was proclaimed.  
`printf`

The proclamation resounded, and was improved upon.  
`std::cout`

Discord arose from name clashes and operator overloading.  Thus was born argument-dependent lookup.  This, too, was judged to be good.  
`using namespace std
cout << "Amen" << endl;`

Blessed entities, henceforth known as namespaces, multiplied over the landscape, constraining scope, enabling concision of naming, and promulgating sensible hierarchies.  And creation endured.  

Now was born the programmer, and set forth upon creation as a child out of the womb.  And the world was harsh.  
`"compilation error"`

Organizational webs entwined.  Description interleaved with content.  Vision was obscured, enlightenment denied, contentment frustrated.  

Until epiphany arrived.  
`emacs`

Thus was the namespace whisperer, that tireless tamer of scopes, bestowed a name.  
`outrespace`

May it last, and do good, as long as it is able.  Though we remeber that all good things must end.  
`exit(0)`
